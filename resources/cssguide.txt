1.1 Always order CSS in a logical way that makes it easy to read. The recommended strategy would be to put “generic” selectors at the top, such as the body, followed by context selectors, classes then IDs.
1.2 Always place @import statements before any rule sets.
2.1 Avoid writing redundant rules if they appear for the same reason. For example, if you want to make all headings red, use a single rule. However, if two unrelated elements are set to have 5px margin, there is no need to factor that out. The general rule here is only group them together if changing one would always mean wanting to change both.
3.1 Never use vendor-prefix CSS rules for homework assignments in this class unless explicitly told otherwise. You may however use them in your creative project if necessary.
4.1 Similar to HTML, there isn’t really any need to make inline comments in CSS, and they can actually make your code less readable. However, you could make some simple comments related to your ordering or if you have some complex CSS animations.
5.1 Place 1 space before the leading brace to begin a rule set.
5.2 Place each rule on its own line. Do not place any rules on the same line as a curly brace.
5.3 Place one space after each colon and none before them.
5.4 Place exactly one blank line between rule sets. Place no blank lines between rules.
5.5 Indent exactly one time for rules. Do not indent anywhere else in CSS.
6.1 Never apply styles to all elements using the * or html selectors. Prefer styling body.
